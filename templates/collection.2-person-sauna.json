What is a far infrared sauna? Is it safe?<\/strong><br\/>Far infrared saunas heat the human body directly with infrared rays instead of air, which increases the body's core temperature, thereby promoting blood circulation and sweating. Compared with traditional steam saunas, the temperature is lower and the experience is gentler, making it more suitable for daily use. The infrared heating panels we use are all designed with low electromagnetic radiation (Low EMF) and have passed multiple safety certifications, making them safe and worry-free for daily use.<\/p><p><br\/><strong>2. How do you assemble your sauna? Is it convenient?<\/strong><br\/>Our saunas are modular and can be easily assembled according to the instructions after receiving the goods. The wooden boards are mostly pre-installed with metal clips, which do not require complicated tools and can be completed by just tightening a few screws. Each model also comes with a video installation guide, which makes it easy to get started.<\/p><p><br\/><strong>3. Does a 2-person sauna require a special circuit?<\/strong><br\/>Yes, some models (especially those with a power of around 2000W) recommend the use of a 20A socket (NEMA 5-20R) to ensure safe and stable operation of the circuit. Please check the \"Electrical Parameters\" column on the product details page before purchasing, or consult our customer service.<\/p><p><br\/><strong>4. What are the dimensions of a 2-person sauna?<\/strong><br\/>The design concept of the Outexer double sauna is to provide sufficient internal space while saving as much floor space as possible. The dimensions of different models vary slightly. Please refer to the detailed specification table at the bottom of each product page for details. There is always one that suits your home space.<\/p>"}},"button_gRDnJY":{"type":"button","disabled":true,"settings":{"button_label":"Button label","button_link":"","button_style_secondary":false,"button_label_2":"","button_link_2":"","button_style_secondary_2":false}}},"block_order":["heading_BKeJXn","text_bgwEym","button_gRDnJY"],"disabled":true,"name":"t:sections.rich-text.presets.name","settings":{"desktop_content_position":"left","content_alignment":"left","color_scheme":"","full_width":true,"padding_top":40,"padding_bottom":52}},"custom_liquid_6e36Pn":{"type":"custom-liquid","name":"t:sections.custom-liquid.presets.name","settings":{"custom_liquid":"<div style=\"background-color: #2F4F4F; padding-top: 40px;\npadding-bottom: 60px;\npadding-left: 20px;\npadding-right: 20px;; text-align: center; color: white;\">\n  <h2 class=\"title inline-richtext h2\" style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n    What You Need to Know About Outexer 2-Person Sauna?\n  <\/h2>\n  <p style=\"font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.6; max-width: 850px; margin: 0 auto 30px auto;\">\n    Learn more about how our two-person saunas can bring comfort, connection and daily wellness to your home.
