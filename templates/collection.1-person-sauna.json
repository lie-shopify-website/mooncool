What is the difference between a single infrared sauna and a steam sauna?<\/strong><br\/>Infrared saunas use infrared rays to directly penetrate deep into the skin for heating, without relying on steam, so the temperature is lower but the sweating is more complete. It is more suitable for daily use and does not require complex ventilation or drainage systems.<br\/><br\/><strong>2. Is your sauna difficult to assemble?<\/strong><br\/>No. All Outexer one-person saunas are modular in design. You can complete the installation in a short time by following the instructions or watching our video tutorials. Most customers can complete the assembly independently.<br\/><br\/><strong>3. Does the single sauna have any circuit requirements?<\/strong><br\/>Most Outexer 1-person saunas have a power of about 800W-1500W, and can usually use ordinary household sockets (120V, 15A) directly.<br\/><br\/><strong>4. What is the size of a single sauna?<\/strong><br\/>Our 1-person saunas are compact in design and suitable for small bedrooms, bathrooms or fitness areas. The specific dimensions can be found on each product detail page.<\/p>"}},"text_zKr8Jw":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>From compact one-person models to spacious family-size saunas, our indoor saunas use minimalist design, natural materials and<br\/>advanced heating technology to create a peaceful, healthy space in your home.<\/p>"}},"button_LYA9pX":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Shop 1-Person Saunas","button_link":"shopify:\/\/collections\/1-person-saunas","button_style_secondary":false,"button_label_2":"","button_link_2":"","button_style_secondary_2":false}}},"block_order":["heading_4R8J7R","text_VJDrWN","text_zKr8Jw","button_LYA9pX"],"disabled":true,"name":"t:sections.rich-text.presets.name","settings":{"desktop_content_position":"center","content_alignment":"center","color_scheme":"scheme-770133dc-45e0-46df-8689-16b4e8d894ba","full_width":true,"padding_top":92,"padding_bottom":88}},"multirow_pzyTm7":{"type":"multirow","blocks":{"row_i3RVqN":{"type":"row","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/1_person_sauna_d1.jpg","image_mb":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/1_person_sauna_d1.jpg","caption":"","heading":"Wellness Starts at Home","text":"<p>Outexer 1-person infrared sauna is designed for your personal relaxation and daily health!
